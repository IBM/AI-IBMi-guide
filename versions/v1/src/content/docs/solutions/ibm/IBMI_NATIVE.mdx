[LLaMa.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) is becoming a popular industry solution
for running Large Language Models (LLMs). It can now be run natively on IBM i!

In the near future, LLaMa.cpp will likely be available as an IBM i RPM and
installable with [the `yum` package manager](http://ibm.biz/ibmi-rpms)

In the meantime, you can build and deploy LLaMa.cpp yourself by following the
steps documented [in this deployment guide](http://ibm.biz/llamacpp-ibmi)
