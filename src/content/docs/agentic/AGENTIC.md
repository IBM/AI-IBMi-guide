Thanks in part to the [Mapepire](https://mapepire-ibmi.github.io/) project, IBM i can be accessed with
Model Context Protocol (MCP) as well as many agentic AI frameworks such as: 
- [BeeAI](https://beeai.dev/)
- [Agno](https://docs.agno.com/)
- [LangChain](http://langchain.com)
- [CrewAI](https://crewai.com/)

Some examples of such can be found in this [Agentic AI Examples](https://github.com/ajshedivy/db2i-agents/tree/main) repository.
